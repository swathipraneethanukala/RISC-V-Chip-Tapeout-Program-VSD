# SoC Tapeout Program VSD 🚀

Welcome to my journey through the **SoC Tapeout Program (VSD)**!  

This repository captures my **step-by-step learning and progress** as I work through weekly tasks and milestones.  

---

## 📌 About the Program
This program offers hands-on experience in designing a **System-on-Chip (SoC)**, starting from **RTL design** and taking it all the way to **GDSII** using open-source EDA tools.  
It is part of one of the **largest collaborative RISC-V tapeout initiatives in India**, bringing together thousands of participants to strengthen the country’s **semiconductor ecosystem** and nurture a new generation of chip designers.

objective: Get the system, tools, and mindset ready for Verilog/VLSI learning. Build confidence with environment setup
## 🌟 Goals of the program
- Document weekly learnings clearly  
- Build a strong foundation in SoC design  
- Contribute to the open-source hardware design movement
